        <h1>WELCOME TO COURAGEOUS CODING!!</h1>
        <h2>Why courageous?</h2>
        <p>Well since you are here! You must be looking to learn more about coding on your own by surfing through the internet. Well!! That’s courageous.</p>
        <p>Coding can be really tiresome at times. Many people often give up half the way. Small errors may take hours in getting detected. For beginners solutions to small issues might not come easy. But if you stick around long enough with dedication and discipline coding can give you an enjoyable career where you can earn money by doing something you love.</p>

              <p>C</p>
            </div>
            <p class="txt-contents">C is a procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language are low-level access to memory and a simple set of keywords these features make C language suitable for system programming’s like an operating system or compiler development.
Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language.

            </div>
            <p class="txt-contents">C++, as we all know is an extension to C language and was developed by Bjarne stroustrup at bell labs. C++ is an intermediate level language, as it comprises a confirmation of both high level and low level language features. C++ is a statically typed, free form, multiparadigm, compiled general-purpose language.
C++ is an Object Oriented Programming language but is not purely Object Oriented. Its features like Friend and Virtual, violate some of the very important OOP features. It’s often considered a middle level languages.

            <p class="txt-contents">Java is an object-oriented programming language with its runtime environment. It is a combination of features of C and C++ with some essential additional concepts. Java is well suited for both standalone and web application development and is designed to provide solutions to most of the problems faced by users of the internet era.</p>

              <p>JavaScript</p>
            </div>
            <p class="txt-contents">JavaScript is most commonly used as a client side scripting language. This means that JavaScript code is written into an HTML page. When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browser to do something with it.
JavaScript can be used in other contexts than a Web browser. Netscape created server-side JavaScript as a CGI-language that can do roughly the same as Perl or ASP. There is no reason why JavaScript couldn’t be used to write real, complex programs.

            </div>
            <p class="txt-contents">Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, or "Matz", in Japan in the mid 1990's. It was designed for programmer productivity with the idea that programming should be fun for programmers. It emphasizes the necessity for software to be understood by humans first and computers second.
Ruby continues to gain popularity for its use in web application development. The Ruby on Rails framework, built with the Ruby language by David Heinemeier Hansson, introduced many people to the joys of programming in Ruby. Ruby has a vibrant community that is supportive for beginners and enthusiastic about producing high-quality code.

            <p class="txt-contents">Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program </p>

<span class="btn message">Tips for Coding</span>
<p>Just start with a basic language like C or java. Read the basics and syntax of the language as reading can take you a long way and save you from errors later. Look up for easy problems statement like printing ‘HELLO WORLD!!’ or addition of two integers and grow up on the way by improving level of problems statements. You can take help from multiple website like https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ or https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ . Good luck on journey and don’t give on coding! Be Courageous!!</p>

<span class="btn message">Common Mistakes</span>

<p>1.	Fear and self-doubt:-You can do it. Don’t give up if you can’t get through an error. These things can take time. Be courageous! </p>
<p>2.	Messy Code-Formatting:-It improves with time. Don’t be discouraged if people can do task in 20 lines of code while you take 100 lines. You will also be able to achieve it with enough practice.</p>
<p>3.	Over-commenting or under-commenting:- Comments helps other coders to understand the code. Watching enough number of good codes can help you use comments efficiently.</p>
<p>4.	Syntax errors:- Check out syntax of your code. Small syntax errors can bring a lot of frustration. So always check your syntax before looking for solutions.</p>
<p>5.	Not backing up your work- Always save your work before closing the system.</p>
